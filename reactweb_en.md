To develop web applications with React, you can follow the steps below:

1. React Installation: First, you need to add React to your project. To use React, you should have Node.js installed and use a package manager like npm or Yarn. Then, you can use the following command to create a React project:

```shell
npx create-react-app project-name
```

This command sets up the basic configuration of your project and installs the necessary dependencies.

2. React Components: React follows a component-based approach. Therefore, you need to create components to build your web interface. Each component can manage its own state and define the HTML structures to be rendered using JSX syntax. For example, you can create a component like this:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

3. Using Components: You can use the components you created in other components or in the main application component. For example, within the main component (App), you can call and arrange other components like this:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';
import Content from './Content';
import Footer from './Footer';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Header />
        <Content />
        <Footer />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

4. React JSX and Props: JSX is a syntax that combines JavaScript with HTML. Using JSX, you can define the HTML structure to be rendered by components. Props are the data that can be passed to components as parameters. For example:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}

export default Greeting;
```

Usage:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Greeting from './Greeting';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Greeting name="Ahmet" />
        <Greeting name="Mehmet" />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

5. React State Management: React provides a mechanism for managing the state within components. When the state of a component changes, React automatically updates only the changed parts of the component. You can use the `setState()` method for state management. For example:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  increment() {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.increment()}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Counter;
```

6. React Router (Optional): React Router is a library used for managing navigation (routing) in web applications. You can use React Router to develop applications with multiple pages or routes. To include React Router in your project, you can use the following command:

```shell
npm install react-router-dom
```

For detailed usage of React Router, you can refer to the documentation.

By following these steps, you can start developing web applications with React. React has a wide ecosystem for building more complex and scalable web applications, so you can explore other libraries and tools that suit your needs.
